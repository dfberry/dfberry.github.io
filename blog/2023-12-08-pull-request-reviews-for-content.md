# Better PR reviews for content

PR reviews for content aren't different from PR reviews for code. If you've been asked to provide a review for content, these tips will ensure your review has the impact worthy of your time. 

## 1. Be kind but clear

Treat the PR as you would want yours treated. If you have an issue with something in the PR, clearly state your issue and a potential fix. 

Do be kind
Do be clear

## 2. Less is more

A PR review, like a code review, should include only changes necessary to approve the PR. 

Don't rewrite the content, in part or en mass. If you believe the content requires this level of work, that communication should be a brief mention of your concerns on the PR and a separate email or chat setting up this larger work. 

Don't reorganize the content. The flow has been established for a reason. If you have a concern, ask for clarity on the flow. 

Do focus on your area of expertise. If the content extends beyond your area of expertise, and you think there is something that needs refinement or rework in those other areas, ask questions in a PR comment. 

## 3. Focus on value

Many types of PR fixes can be applied automatically and have extensive rule sets for that purpose. If you think a change needs to be made, comment on the PR only if you think the change has slipped past the automated quality gates. 

Don't fix grammar or punctuation. Instead ask for a rerun of those automated tasks indicating your concern. 
Do focus on content concerns that aren't automated. If you aren't sure what has been automated, ask.

## 4. Change for longevity

If you rework an area, make sure the change is such that the next person coming through won't have a different rework. This comes up in content that has issues with clarity and exactness. Everyone has a different idea of how to clarify the specificity. 

Instead, add a PR comment with the disconnect from your perspective. What is correct, and how is the current content not correct - or open to misinterpretation?

## 5. Images, screenshots, and diagrams

If you ask for more visual aids, add a PR comment about the clarity you think is missing that should be provided with a graphic. If you think existing visual content is missing the mark, specify how and why.
