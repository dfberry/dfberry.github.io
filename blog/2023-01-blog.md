# TypeScript type guard for empty JSON object

A commit history for a repo on GitHub can be optional, if there are no commits yet. The TypeScript SDK created by the [GraphQL CodeGen](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@graphql-codegen/cli) represents this optionality is represented with an empty object, null, or undefined. If a commit is present, its represented as a nested JSON object with more optional parameters.

```typescript
declare var x:
  {} |
  null |
  undefined |
  {'a':
      { ... more optional params }
  }
```

The empty JSON object, `{}`, is tricky in JavaScript. There are several examples of testing for an empty object but they generally don't work as type guards in TypeScript for type safety.

## Type guard with `in`

After asking on [StackOverlow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75278401/how-do-i-get-type-target-history-from-github-graphql-on-defaultbranchref) and getting no response, I reached out to my local TypeScript expert for help.

He helped boil the issue down to the type shown in the previous code block with a type guard using the `in` keyword:

```typescript
if (x !== null && x !== undefined && "a" in x) {
  // no null
  // not undefined
  // x has property 'a' so it isn't empty
  console.log(x.a);
}
```
