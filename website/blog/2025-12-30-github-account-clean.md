# Clean up my many GitHub account repositories

My end of year project is a GitHub account repository-cleanup tool to provide safe, repeatable auditing and cleanup for my GitHub accounts. I also wanted to create a catalog of my active repos. This repo focuses on repository-level cleanup (archive/delete/catalog), but the same audit run can help you discover candidates for cloud-resource reclamation and CI/workflow maintenance.

When to use this project
- Periodic account maintenance (end-of-year or scheduled audits).
- Before publishing a portfolio or transferring repositories.
- When you want a reproducible audit with a dry-run-first approach.

## Functionality included in GitHub account cleanup

My [TypeScript project](https://github.com/dfberry/gh) cleans up my account in the following way:

- Archive stale repositories, 
- Detect and delete empty repositories, 
- Remove forks, 
- Generate repo descriptions and topics with LLM and update repos with that info,
- Generate a catalog of active repos for publishing.

## High level architecture

![1- primary entry is `scripts/run-all.sh` 2- workflows are optional 3- gh-cleanup calls github-rest and llm-completion 4- outputs go to generated/](media/2025-12-30-github-account-clean/architecture.png)


The high-level architecture of the npm workspace monorepo: 
- `packages/gh-cleanup` — CLI commands and orchestration: categorization rules, scoring, reporting, and the runner that coordinates dry-run and apply flows.
- `packages/github-rest` — GitHub REST helpers, typed endpoint wrappers, and shared network utilities. 
- `packages/llm-completion` — LLM/AI utilities: prompt helpers, request wrappers, retries, and response sanitization used by the describe step.
- `generated/` — Example outputs created by dry-run executions: `catalog.md`, `active.json`, `descriptions.json`, summaries, etc.
- `.github` - Workflows and prompt files. 
- `scripts` - Top level script to clean up GitHub account, also used by 

## Prerequisites

This repo can be opened with Codespaces or locally with `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`. The development container has all the developer setup for this project including Node.js. Once you have the repo open with the environment, create a GitHub token and an OpenAI key and an LLM model. Set these values in the root level `.env`.

- A GitHub token in `GH_TOKEN` (classic PAT with `repo` scopes; `delete_repo` only required for destructive operations such as deleting a repo.)
- OpenAI key for LLM generation of repo descriptions and topics and an LLM model. I used 4.1-mini from Azure OpenAI.

```ini
GH_TOKEN=
GH_USER=YOUR_GITHUB_USER_ACCOUNT
OPENAI_API_KEY=
OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://RESOURCE-NAME.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/MODEL_NAME/chat/completions?api-version=API_VERSION
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4.1-mini
OPENAI_TEMPERATURE=0.2
```

## Install and build dependencies

The root `package.json` uses npm workspaces to control and access all the packages in `./packages`. Use the root `package.json` scripts to install and build the tool.

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

## Try out the tool

One-line run examples

- Remove forks (dry-run):

	```bash
	npm run start -w gh-cleanup -- remove-forks
	```

- Archive stale repos older than a year (dry-run):

	```bash
	npm run start -w gh-cleanup -- archive-stale-repos
	```

- Delete empty repos, no PRs, no commits, size is 0 KB (dry-run):

	```bash
	npm run start -w gh-cleanup -- delete-empty-repos
	```

- Categorize repos (fetch languages + README, output Markdown):

	```bash
	npm run start -w gh-cleanup -- categorize-repos --fetch --output=md --out=generated/catalog.md
	```

- Summary (write `generated/summary.md`):

	This creates the final active list of repos in a markdown table. I'll use this in my dfberry.github.io website to find projects with specific code, configuration, or CI.

	```bash
	npm run start -w gh-cleanup -- summary --summary-out=generated/summary.md
	```

## Full run 

Once you understand what the tool does, use the `./scripts/run-all.sh` to clean up your GitHub account. I used my personal `dfberry` account to test while building. Now that it is complete, I'll use it on my work `diberry` account for Microsoft. 

```bash
npm run run-all:apply
```

The `apply` means empty repos are deleted and active repos are updated for description and topics. 

## AI-assisted development

I use AI tools (Copilot, Ask/Plan/Agent) to speed development while keeping human oversight. I commit frequently and review AI suggestions line-by-line. Choose models and session types (local, background, cloud) deliberately to control cost and behavior. Never let AI run unattended on critical changes—use dry runs and manual tests. I scaffold the repo, add features incrementally, and document decisions so I can return later. Copilot helps with comments and diagrams, but I always review and adjust its output.

## Next steps

Cleanup goes beyond removing unused repositories. When tidying a personal or org GitHub account you may also:

- Reclaim unused cloud resources referenced by projects (e.g., old deployments, test clusters, or storage buckets).
- Remove or archive unused repositories that are forks, abandoned, or no longer relevant.
- Find and fix failing or stale GitHub Actions workflows (update action versions or workflow syntax) or remove workflows that are no longer useful.
- Update CI matrices and runtimes (programming language versions, OS matrix entries) to reduce CI cost and avoid testing very-old combinations.
- Bump pinned GitHub Action versions and dependencies to address deprecations and security fixes.
